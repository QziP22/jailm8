# bootm8
An even better iso that is only 10 mb that lets users jb with checkra1n

This project started off when I decided to make my own version of checkn1x, which also supported project sandcastle

So that got me thinking, I could do this myself, I dont need someone else doing the hard work

Plus quarantine got me bored

How to use:

1. Download rufus or any other live usb maker

2. Write the latest iso to a usb,this usb can be reused afterwards

3. Boot onto the usb from your computers BIOS

4. You should eventually get to checkra1n


Now this step changes depending on what you are trying to do:

-To run checkra1n normally continue

-To run project sandcastle:

Go into "options"

In the boot arguements box type "p"

Continue with the jailbreak process

Now your device should boot into whats called PongoOS

Now quit checkra1n

Again this step splits depending on what you wish to do"

-To boot Android, type:

"android"


-To boot Linux, (guess):

"linux"



NOTE: etcher will not work when writing the iso

Thanks to the checkra1n team for checkra1n

Thanks to asineth0 for inspiration and teaching me(without knowing) about squashfs and linux terminal commands
